# Neopets Cypress Automation

This repository contains Cypress test scripts written in JavaScript/TypeScript that automate tasks in the browser-based game _Neopets_.

Test scripts are found inside the **_cypress/e2e_** directory. The _E2E_ directory contains multiple sub-directories:

- **Dailies** - Activities and minigames that can only be carried out once a day.
- **Etc** - Activities that can be carried out multiple times in a single day.
- **Faeries** - Scripts for the Faerie quests.
- **Scratchcards** - Scripts for buy and scratch the different scratchcards.
- **Wheels** - These are scripts to play the different Wheel minigames.

## Disclaimer

This repository has been created with the intention of demonstrating my knowledge of Cypress to potential employers in a way I find enjoyable. It is not intended for usage in botting or automating gameplay beyond the test account.

The code has been tested using only a single account to avoid breaking Neopets’ rule on playing games such as the “Wheels” or “Scratchcard Kiosks” with multiple accounts and to minimise its effect on the game overall.

I will remove this repository if Neopets, Inc. wish me to and I understand if they decide to freeze the account I used to test this code.
