# Neopets Cypress Automation

This repository contains Cypress test scripts written in JavaScript/TypeScript to automate tasks in the browser-based game Neopets.

Test scripts are found inside the ***cypress/e2e*** directory.

## Disclaimer
This repository has been created with the intention of demonstrating my experience with Cypress to potential employers and is not intended for usage in botting.

The code has been tested using only a single account to avoid breaking Neopets’ rule on playing games such as the “Wheels” or “Scratchcard Kiosks” with multiple accounts.
